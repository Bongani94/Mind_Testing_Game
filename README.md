## Aim 🔤 my aim was to practice how to create ``front-end development while gaining experience``. Things that push me to do this one, is because almost everyone loves to play games, but most of it is to push time without gaining knowledge. This one of mine, I want everyone to gain knowledge and learn to do research in google because some question that is already inside, if you want to understand it you will go through google or ask people.

## Challanges 📉
> While I thought I’m done with my project, when I tried to run it was not showing everything in order, I had to debug and fix everything to be able to start testing my mind. When I clicked play or create option was not going through, I had to debug again, until I was able to go through it. The time limit was not working. I had to debug to fix the problem until I saw the time limit work. Because I wanted my game to have sound, I had to search and understand everything about sound, but after I coded everything, I found that my game does not have a sound, which is where I debugged again until when I played it I heard a sound.

# Programe that design this game is 🏗️
> For front-end development, [Html](./index.html) I used, [CSS](./css) and [JavaScript](./js). My additional framework I used [Sassy](./sass), so that I can learn more about fronted. I used  [JSON](./package.json) so that I can learn how to interchange data between the frontend and backend components of a web application.
